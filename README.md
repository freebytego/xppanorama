Windows XP Themed Panorama UI for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive

**Installation:**
-First you need [HLAE](https://www.advancedfx.org/download/)
-Do steps from [this tutorial](https://github.com/advancedfx/advancedfx/wiki/How-to-change-Panorama-UI)
-Download everything here and unzip it to csgo folder

It should work, but if it doesn't you need to update it manually.
